The notebooks in this repository were used in the capstone project for the IBM Data Science certification.  This project involves analyzing launch records gathered from SpaceX API and webscraping to understand landing success rates for SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets.  Additionally, the project required building classification models to predict landing success using features associated with historical launch records.
