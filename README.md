The notebooks in this repository were used in the capstone project for the IBM Data Science certification.  This project involves analyzing launch records gathered from SpaceX API and webscraping to understand landing success rate for SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets.  Additionally, the project requires building classification models to predict landing success using features associated with each launch.
